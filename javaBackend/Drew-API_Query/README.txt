The code here is what was exported to Simple_API_Query_Endpoint.jar

This project serves the purpose of making requests to the API when provided URL parameters like artistName and trackName.
The project then maps a JSON response to objects and rewrites those objects to JSON, hosting them on an HTTP endpoint running on port 8081.

External Library Dependencies are managed by Apache Maven - as shown in project POM files.

All projects are Maven projects in Eclipse.
